#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) is looping while a < n

b) O(n^2) it has a nested loop

c) O(n) because is like like exercise (a).

## Exercise II

drop the egg, if it breaks call function recursively -1 until egg doesn't break
base can be (if n == 1)
runtime complexity would be O(n)
